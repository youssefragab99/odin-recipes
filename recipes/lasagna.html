        <li> 1/2 cup (120ml) water</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon dried basil</li>

        <li> 1/2 teaspoon salt</li>

        <li> 1 container (15 ounces/425g) ricotta cheese</li>
        <li> 1 egg</li>
        <li> 1/4 cup (30g) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li> 3 cups (about 12 ounces/340g) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <p></p>
    <strong>Instructions:</strong>
    <p></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>

        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>

        <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened,
            about 5
            minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute.</li>

        <li>Add the ground beef or Italian sausage to the skillet and cook until browned, breaking it up into smaller
            pieces as
            it cooks.</li>

        <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, water, basil, oregano, salt, black pepper, and crushed red
            pepper flakes
            (if using). Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it cook for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally,
            until it</li>
        thickens slightly.</li>

        <li>In a separate bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, egg, and grated Parmesan cheese until well combined.
        </li>

        <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.
            Place three
            lasagna noodles on top of the sauce.</li>

        <li>Spread half of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a third of the shredded mozzarella
            cheese.</li>

        <li>Repeat the layers - meat sauce, noodles, ricotta mixture, and mozzarella cheese.</li>

        <li>1For the final layer, top with the remaining meat sauce and mozzarella cheese.</li>

        <li>1Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then remove the
            foil and
            bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>

        <li>1Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy your delicious homemade lasagna!
